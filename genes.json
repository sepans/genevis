This was facilitated by British and Dutch trading companies in South Asia, the trade routes of the Ottoman Empire, and the Spanish administration of South America, amongst many other channels. China, Japan and Korea each experienced dramatic economic expansion and artistic flourishing, but while Chinese goods travelled widely through the global market, Japan maintained a closed economy. The great variety of artistic production in Europe in the 17th century is often loosely grouped under the term “[Baroque](/gene/baroque)”, which in general terms is characterized by a heightened sense of movement and lighting in compositions. In painting, these elements were perhaps first mastered by Caravaggio, who heavily influenced artists across Europe; amongst these were [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) in Spain and and [Rembrandt](/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1) in Holland. The exuberance of Baroque aesthetics combined with the fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation is evident in the re-constructed St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a project which was seen to completion by [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini). The taste for Baroque art travelled to the Americas, as evidenced by ornate religious buildings most notably in Mexico and Peru. In France, the century witnessed the consolidation of power under absolute monarchy, whose decadence was made visible in the construction of Louis XIV's royal palace at Versailles; the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was also established under his rule. In the Dutch Republic, whose independence was gained from Spain after 80 years of conflict, an affluent mercantile class created the conditions for a dynamic art market with a preference for portraits, still lifes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life.\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/JWbwcX077-tmSfaCgsjmeg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/JWbwcX077-tmSfaCgsjmeg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/51b662878b3b81ec27000281"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/17th-century"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=51b662878b3b81ec27000281"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=51b662878b3b81ec27000281&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=51b662878b3b81ec27000281"}}},{"id":"51b662718b3b816b5c00034b","created_at":"2013-06-10T23:34:09+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-26T23:29:30+00:00","name":"18th Century","display_name":"18th Century Art","description":"A category for any work of art created during the 18th century, which witnessed two of the most influential periods of the modern age: the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.

The global conflict of WWII was marked by unprecedented crimes against humanity and left behind unprecedented destruction when it ended in 1945. In the fall-out, the world was divided into adversarial spheres of influence (the Cold War), while towards the end of the 1950s former European colonies fought for independence.

The hub of Western artistic activity was Paris, and the French Academy and Salon represented the establishment, favoring [Neoclassicism](/gene/neoclassicism) at the beginning of the century and later [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism). Social and political commentary appeared in the history paintings of [Théodore Géricault](/artist/theodore-gericault) and [Francisco Goya](/artist/francisco-jose-de-goya-y-lucientes-1) as well as the Social Realist works of [Gustave Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet) and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier).

Japan's opening to global trade and the subsequent arrival of Japanese objects in Europe were a significant influence. At the same time, photography emerged as a means of documenting social realities and an art form accessible to non-elites. Architecture was characterized by the use of new industrial materials and techniques, on the the one hand, and the revival of Classical and Gothic styles, on the other.

The artist plays a significant role in traditional Aboriginal society, as artworks are seen as sacred forms of religious knowledge. What is widely understood as Contemporary Aboriginal Art has its roots in an art teacher named Geoffrey Bardon, who in 1971 gave art materials to a group of Aboriginal men in Papunya; when it sparked their interest, he worked with 11 men to form a cooperative, the Papunya Tula Artists, which has since grown to include 60 artists nationwide.

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SD2uVfB7CFYudQXuAWym_A/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SD2uVfB7CFYudQXuAWym_A/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/505b5a9b930ad000020008e0"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/abstract-versus-figurative-art"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=505b5a9b930ad000020008e0"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=505b5a9b930ad000020008e0&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=505b5a9b930ad000020008e0"}}},{"id":"545ab9b17261691cf0be0000","created_at":"2014-11-05T23:58:41+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:51+00:00","name":"Abstraction-Création","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_aVGv4MHrBk6jIU3U7Moeg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_aVGv4MHrBk6jIU3U7Moeg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/545ab9b17261691cf0be0000"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/abstraction-creation"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=545ab9b17261691cf0be0000"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=545ab9b17261691cf0be0000&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=545ab9b17261691cf0be0000"}}},{"id":"526700b98b3b81ab780002eb","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:48:25+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-11T19:17:01+00:00","name":"Action Painting","display_name":null,"description":"A term coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 to define a specific set of Abstract Expressionist artists who saw the canvas as an “arena in which to act.” Artists like [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock), [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), and [Franz Kline](/artist/franz-kline) were associated with this term due to their more spontaneous and/or physical act of painting.

Often informed by Pan-Africanism, or the solidarity of African peoples worldwide, aesthetic approaches to the African Diaspora may critique the economies of the transatlantic slave trade, histories of colonialism and its legacies, as well as celebrate the cultural and artistic accomplishments of people of African descent (directly countering the alignment of African art with Primitivism, a trend amongst European modern artists like [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and the German Expressionist group [Die Brücke](/gene/die-brucke)).

For Fontana, the alteration of a canvas in his \"Concetto Spaziale\" (spatial concept) series was a way to move beyond the picture plane and activate the space behind and around the work.

Most visual representations of this science take the form of illustrations and diagrams that often blur distinctions between science and art. This can be seen in the rich tradition of Persian medical illustration or in the medical diagrams of historic Chinese texts. Renaissance artists, most famously Leonardo da Vinci, also demonstrated a scientific interest in the human body; Da Vinci created anatomical sketches from autopsies he performed himself. One of the most influential books on anatomy, Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica, published in Basel in 1543, contains lavish woodcut illustrations attributed to the workshop of Titian, highlighting art’s primary role in communicating truth and scientific knowledge during the Renaissance; it was at this time that the study of anatomy became foundational in artistic apprenticeship. Contemporary artists have used anatomy and anatomical drawing to interrogate scientific knowledge or to comment on the powerful relationship between humans and nature. While most medical anatomies in world history have centered on the male body as the universal human form, the anatomy of the female genitalia has been used to represent femininity and female power, from abstracted prehistoric figurines depicting goddesses of fertility to the provocative use of vaginal imagery by feminist artist [Judy Chicago](https://www.artsy.net/artist/judy-chicago) in such works as Rejection Breakthrough Drawing (1974).\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/megeKTyN2X2tzbBhaeWV7w/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/megeKTyN2X2tzbBhaeWV7w/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/544ecdd072616939702e1300"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/anatomy"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=544ecdd072616939702e1300"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=544ecdd072616939702e1300&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=544ecdd072616939702e1300"}}},{"id":"5378c7d0ebad648603000098","created_at":"2014-05-18T14:46:40+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-12T12:20:27+00:00","name":"Ancient Art","display_name":null,"description":"Between approximately 5000 BC and 300 AD, “advanced” civilizations (generally, those with written language) thrived in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Sumeria, Akkadia, Mexico, Rome, Japan, China, and India.

For example, one of the most famous artworks from ancient [Mesopotamia](/gene/mesopotamian-art), often called the “cradle of civilization,” is the _[Code of Hammurabi](/artwork/code-de-hammurabi-roi-de-babylone-code-of-hammurabi-king-of-babylon)_, a set of laws carved in stone and adorned by an image of King Hammurabi and the Mesopotamian god Shabash.

James Stuart Blackton's _Humorous Phases of Funny Faces_ is arguably considered the first animation; Emil Cohl's _Fantasmagorie_ is considered the first animated film. From its rough beginnings in the 20th century, animation has become one of the most popular forms of world entertainment.

The extent to which each of these forms is related, as well as the history of the term “arabesque,” is hotly debated among art historians. Arabesque has a specific meaning in [Islamic art](/gene/islamic-art-and-architecture), where it refers to the vegetal patterned surface decorations that flourished from the 10th to 15th centuries and adorned walls from Spain to Northern Africa, highly ornamented [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), or intricate patterning on sculpture and other objects. Its meaning in other aesthetic traditions is less clear (some art historians argue that it should only be used to describe Islamic art). Starting in the late Renaissance in Europe, it was used nearly interchangeably with the terms “[grotesque](/gene/grotesque)” and “moresque” to describe complex, curvilinear patterning. By the [Rococo](/gene/rococo) period of the 17th century, the form had become extremely popular, and swooping S-scrolls in high relief adorned furniture, architectural elements, tableware, and other decorative objects. Arabesques and related scroll shapes appear in classical art and decoration, in Chinese art, and in contemporary art throughout the world.

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world. Contemporary uses of calligraphy can be found in [Ghada Amer](/artist/ghada-amer)'s sculptures, [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat-2)'s photography, and [Shahzia Sikhander](/artist/shahzia-sikander)'s drawings and paintings.\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/N5gUV-wuaCwoxOXciRQbDw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/N5gUV-wuaCwoxOXciRQbDw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/50649fd87ca2ea00020005da"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=50649fd87ca2ea00020005da"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=50649fd87ca2ea00020005da&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=50649fd87ca2ea00020005da"}}},{"id":"54e5147f726169585bfd0100","created_at":"2015-02-18T22:38:55+00:00","updated_at":"2017-06-18T10:34:12+00:00","name":"Archaeological Object","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/xbN_Ubh3WHO8r2HZet622Q/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/xbN_Ubh3WHO8r2HZet622Q/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/54e5147f726169585bfd0100"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/archaeological-object"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=54e5147f726169585bfd0100"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=54e5147f726169585bfd0100&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=54e5147f726169585bfd0100"}}},{"id":"4f99da92d8f65a0001000732","created_at":"2012-04-26T23:30:26+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-07T12:17:34+00:00","name":"Architecture","display_name":null,"description":"A general category for buildings and monuments.

Certain body parts—particularly eyes, hands, feet, and lips—are more commonly represented than others, however what is (and what is not) represented is highly dependent on the specific culture in which the art is created.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_mdz7cVaIlBny1y6fSuLDA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_mdz7cVaIlBny1y6fSuLDA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/50b99130bf92aeca17000120"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/body-parts"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=50b99130bf92aeca17000120"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=50b99130bf92aeca17000120&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=50b99130bf92aeca17000120"}}},{"id":"51505e04508c09dabd00006a","created_at":"2013-03-25T14:24:04+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:43+00:00","name":"Bone","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks and design objects made in whole or in part from bone, including any part of the skeleton of an [animal](/gene/animals), such as a [skull](/tag/skull).

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences.

Brutalist buildings are recognizable for their rough appearance, linear, fortresslike, and blocky construction, as well as their use of common, industrial materials such as steel, glass, brick, and, most characteristically, raw concrete. Additionally, many Brutalist structures' functional components (such as water tanks, electrical towers, and support pillars) are left exposed on the outside of the building. As an architectural philosophy, Brutalism was often associated with utopian socialist ideology. Completed in 1952, Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse—a public housing complex in Marseille that was built under the premise that each resident should have the same amount of space and equal access to sunlight—is often cited as the initial inspiration for the Brutalist style. Criticism of the style centers around its cold appearance.

Its most iconic expression was a performance titled “Living with Pop – A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism,” orchestrated by Richter and Lueg in the Berges department store in Dusseldorf that same year. The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American. Against the backdrop of the Cold War and a divided Germany, the fake movement’s title also alluded to the Soviet doctrine of [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism). The concerns of so-called Capitalist Realism—heavy-handed irony, investigation of the political aspects of consumerism, and critique of popular culture—have been seen by some as predecessors to a German strain of Pop Art, though the existence thereof is, itself, debatable.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/KX6a5mdTJd5cVrqCC-yb9A/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/KX6a5mdTJd5cVrqCC-yb9A/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4dee3a151695f00001002c25"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/capitalist-realism"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4dee3a151695f00001002c25"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4dee3a151695f00001002c25&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4dee3a151695f00001002c25"}}},{"id":"50f07a28e9a3fe93ee00008f","created_at":"2013-01-11T20:46:32+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-30T20:12:36+00:00","name":"Caravaggesque","display_name":null,"description":"Painted in the style of [Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio](/artist/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio).

Gombrich_\n\nCaricatures exaggerate features of individuals for the purpose of humor, mockery or criticism. Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings. These modes—in particular parody—have been of interest to late-20th-century artists in part because of their prevalence in culture at large, as the popularity of the mockumentary, satirical sketch comedy, lampoons, and spoofs attests.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/FETOkU18A-YzS0wUsR8yDQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/FETOkU18A-YzS0wUsR8yDQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5064837849bc8800020003f4"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/caricatures-and-parody"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5064837849bc8800020003f4"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5064837849bc8800020003f4&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5064837849bc8800020003f4"}}},{"id":"512b65ee5a2a7775d80000d4","created_at":"2013-02-25T13:23:58+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-11T19:17:05+00:00","name":"Carving","display_name":null,"description":"Perhaps the earliest technique for creating three-dimensional forms or decoration, carving is the act of shaping, marking, or decorating wood, stone, or other materials by cutting or incising—as opposed to sculpting by building up a material like clay.

Examples of carving can be found in ancient objects the world over, from paleolithic objects decorated with animal forms found in France to Shang dynasty oracle bones incised with ancient writing from China, and classical Greek Caryatid figures still standing today on the Acropolis. Even thousands of years ago, artists like the anonymous sculptor of a voluptuous 10th-century Yogini from India experimented with the ability of carved imagery to operate in both two and three dimensions, creating dramatic volume in contrast to flat space. To this day, carving continues to take forms both minute and monumental, from virtuosic carved sculptures to paintings incised for texture.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/NgyxJNcUF65KUmbVlSF0mQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/NgyxJNcUF65KUmbVlSF0mQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/512b65ee5a2a7775d80000d4"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/carving"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=512b65ee5a2a7775d80000d4"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=512b65ee5a2a7775d80000d4&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=512b65ee5a2a7775d80000d4"}}},{"id":"50786fb891f2b00002000478","created_at":"2012-10-12T19:30:00+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:40+00:00","name":"Caucasus","display_name":"Caucasus Art","description":"Artists who are from or who have lived in the Caucasus region.

Greek mythology, concerned largely with the lives of gods and heroic humans, has origins in oral tradition but was recorded by poets such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Roman mythology, which borrowed heavily from Greek predecessors, often dealt with myths of origin, social institutions, and human destiny; key poets included Virgil and Ovid and central stories include those of the She-Wolf of the Capitoline and the Rape of the Sabine Women. Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought.

In the collage, a printed oilcloth simulated chair caning and a piece of rope functioned as both a frame and the border of a café table. Collage was an assault on painting and its proposal of imaginary space as well as the proper materials of art. For example, [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)' collages and assemblages brought the detritus of street life and modern life's [printed ephemera](/gene/printed-matter)—ticket stubs, newspapers, postage stamps—into the realm of high art.

And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand.

This is partly due to the diminishing cost barriers of 3-D printing, a process in which typically plastic- or metal-based materials are deposited layer by layer. Other CAM processes include subtractive techniques, in which material is removed from a large starting block (usually of wood or metal) until the digitally designed form is achieved. The two most common types of this technique are CNC routing and milling. Both use a movable rotating cutter guided by digital instructions that cut into and carve a starting block of material.

Strong, cheaper than traditional stone, and easily transportable, concrete is made by combining water with an aggregate (such as small pieces of stones or brick) and a binder (such as lime or cement) and then allowing the malleable mass to harden; it is often reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase its tensile strength. Underutilized for centuries after the classical period, it became a mainstay of modern architecture and infrastructure. It has been used to construct both masterpieces of aesthetic innovation, such as Le Corbusier’s [_Notre Dame du Haut_](/artwork/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-notre-dame-du-haut-ronchamp-france), and the massive housing blocks and anonymous, utilitarian structures that fueled 20th-century urbanization.

Later to be called \"cold abstraction,\" this style was often criticized for its transcendental bent and failure to confront the world. [Lucio Fontana](/artist/lucio-fontana), for example, though associated briefly with the Italian Movimento Arte Concreta (M.A.C.), ultimately found his practice to be at odds with the \"sterile and empty\" formalism of this tendency.

After flourishing for some 20 years, by the 1950s the cerebral concerns of this art—its exploration of pure form and universal principles—were being eclipsed by the more expressive gestural abstraction coming out of the [New York School](/gene/new-york-school) and the [School of Paris](/gene/post-world-war-ii-school-of-paris).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/R9piskSGMx7ViGCpnh6IVw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/R9piskSGMx7ViGCpnh6IVw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/50258685db291000020008cd"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/concrete-art"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=50258685db291000020008cd"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=50258685db291000020008cd&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=50258685db291000020008cd"}}},{"id":"4db9b645db68d133c600123e","created_at":"2011-04-28T18:47:33+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-10T17:15:04+00:00","name":"Conflict","display_name":null,"description":"Works that include scenes of personal and/or political conflict, including verbal, physical, or ideological struggles for power or agency (as in fights, wars, or arguments) or acts of opposition or antagonism (such as protests).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TR2--uSi28wQsaKCkJ6Q1A/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TR2--uSi28wQsaKCkJ6Q1A/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4db9b645db68d133c600123e"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/conflict"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4db9b645db68d133c600123e"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4db9b645db68d133c600123e&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4db9b645db68d133c600123e"}}},{"id":"5771dda0b202a365e7000a68","created_at":"2016-06-28T02:14:56+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-14T09:43:26+00:00","name":"Console","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["thumb","square500","big_and_tall","tall"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wsyJgW1MgMqw130O3dWSZA/thumb.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wsyJgW1MgMqw130O3dWSZA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5771dda0b202a365e7000a68"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/console"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5771dda0b202a365e7000a68"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5771dda0b202a365e7000a68&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5771dda0b202a365e7000a68"}}},{"id":"4d90d190dcdd5f44a500003d","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2017-10-07T02:36:10+00:00","name":"Constructivism","display_name":null,"description":"A 20th-century movement in painting, sculpture, photography, design, and architecture that began in Russia in the late teens and quickly reached an international audience.

With the rise of abstract art in the 20th century, realist painting ceased to be the dominant mode of art-making, being viewed as less progressive, or even retrograde.

In a series of sober portraits from the 1920s, German photographer [August Sander](/artist/august-sander) systematically documented his countrymen; the uniform staging and composition of these works accentuated social and professional markings, turning his subjects into social types. This series revealed a tension between a photograph’s ability to reveal something of a sitter’s individuality and inner life, and its exact representation of outward appearance. In recent practice, many photographers have also tried to present their subjects as they really are, flaws and all, while allowing for moments of candidness and vulnerability. Less austere (and more deliberate) than a mug shot, these works often bring facial features into high relief, allowing expressiveness to recede and making the sitter seem somehow up-close and removed at the same time.

A common practice in multiple historical periods across nations, artists closely reproduced, sometimes verbatim, esteemed works of art or pieces deemed iconic in order to make them more portable, pay homage to their original creator, or to learn from them. Pre-modern Chinese artists, for example, reproduced paintings of earlier masters as an integral part of their learning process, to proclaim their artistic lineage, or to perpetuate older works created with ephemeral materials. Notably, [ancient Roman](/gene/roman-art-and-architecture) artists produced an unprecedented number of statues that took after [Greek sculpture](/gene/greek-art-and-architecture). The cultural and artistic agency behind these emulations often far exceeded the restrictive meaning of a “copy,” the term art historians have used to describe these works.

Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.” After 1910, Picasso and Braque’s Cubism was quickly adopted by many other artists in Paris and beyond and ended up being the primary influence on most or all abstract art before the outbreak of World War II.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/q6LzpHz6oYJrrVkEdG_eYQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/q6LzpHz6oYJrrVkEdG_eYQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4d90d190dcdd5f44a500003e"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/cubism"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4d90d190dcdd5f44a500003e"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4d90d190dcdd5f44a500003e&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4d90d190dcdd5f44a500003e"}}},{"id":"4e5fe867e890b10001023609","created_at":"2011-09-01T20:17:43+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-12T07:56:01+00:00","name":"Cultural Commentary","display_name":null,"description":"A broad category for artworks that comment on various aspects of contemporary culture, often quite critically, as in works that focus on the misdeeds of political figures, the imperial actions of governments, or global economic inequalities.

Deconstructivism is most closely associated with the architects Peter Eisenman, [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry), Hadid, Coop Himelblau, [Rem Koolhaas](/artist/rem-koolhaas), Daniel Liebeskind, and Bernard Tschumi, largely due to the Museum of Modern Art’s 1988 exhibition “Deconstructivist Architecture,” which first brought them together.

Many artists have appropriated sacred imagery for a secular context. [Chris Ofili](https://www.artsy.net/artist/chris-ofili)’s Holy Virgin Mary (1996), for example, is an image of a black Mary that incorporates elephant dung, a provocative melding of the sacred and the profane that caused an uproar when exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1999.

Contemporary painters such as [Glenn Brown](/artist/glenn-brown) and [Albert Oehlen](/artist/albert-oehlen) bridge the digital-analog divide by using manipulation software to transform source images, translating computerized brushstrokes into oil paint, which they then apply on canvas.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/GfT0ZHJKO-871HHjLJsPgw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/GfT0ZHJKO-871HHjLJsPgw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/565b39089acc8a63fb00006c"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/digitally-manipulated"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=565b39089acc8a63fb00006c"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=565b39089acc8a63fb00006c&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=565b39089acc8a63fb00006c"}}},{"id":"507c499a024bd20002001986","created_at":"2012-10-15T17:36:26+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-14T16:12:18+00:00","name":"Dining Table","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/t1GcPke8m7EO7AFePP59LA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/t1GcPke8m7EO7AFePP59LA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/507c499a024bd20002001986"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/dining-table"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=507c499a024bd20002001986"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=507c499a024bd20002001986&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=507c499a024bd20002001986"}}},{"id":"4e5e8792ed9e120001002625","created_at":"2011-08-31T19:12:18+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:05+00:00","name":"Disaster","display_name":null,"description":"Used in describing artworks that take a disaster as their subject.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ng7fzgGsCI2eGFsMG23qeg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ng7fzgGsCI2eGFsMG23qeg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e5e8792ed9e120001002625"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/disaster"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e5e8792ed9e120001002625"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e5e8792ed9e120001002625&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e5e8792ed9e120001002625"}}},{"id":"5568b74d7261693634a20000","created_at":"2015-05-29T19:00:29+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-14T09:43:27+00:00","name":"Divinatory Objects, Talismans, and Amulets","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_GP0Dgy5uZxdEngweywhbA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_GP0Dgy5uZxdEngweywhbA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5568b74d7261693634a20000"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/divinatory-objects-talismans-and-amulets"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5568b74d7261693634a20000"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5568b74d7261693634a20000&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5568b74d7261693634a20000"}}},{"id":"5489e02a72616955e3260000","created_at":"2014-12-11T18:19:22+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-08T21:53:22+00:00","name":"Divisionist","display_name":null,"description":"Divisionism, traditionally speaking, refers to the style developed by [Neo-Impressionist painters](/gene/neo-impressionism) in an effort to compose images through the use of small units of pigment (dots, dashes, etc.), with an emphasis on the optical effect that complementary colors placed near each other on the canvas would have on the eye.

Historically, until the broad use of color photography, documentary photography was black and white and captured events with precise focus, limited distortions, and minimal darkroom editing, with the understanding that to manipulate was to distort the truth. It also has characteristically carried a social imperative: to expose what life is like truthfully—in cities, in poverty, in disasters—and to encourage societal progress. Accordingly, some of the best-known historical documentary photographers were also heavily involved in activist causes against poverty and child labor, such as [Jacob Riis](/artist/jacob-august-riis) and [Lewis Hine](/artist/lewis-wickes-hine). Today, more and more, questions of what constitutes a true documentary photograph arise, thanks to artists who complicate the divisions between fact and fiction (such as [Jeff Wall](/artist/jeff-wall)) as well as the extensive capabilities of digital manipulation.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/29vnl4jP5-lkgVMd9sy0Ow/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/29vnl4jP5-lkgVMd9sy0Ow/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4d90d193dcdd5f44a5000089"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/documentary-photography"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4d90d193dcdd5f44a5000089"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4d90d193dcdd5f44a5000089&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4d90d193dcdd5f44a5000089"}}},{"id":"53062217c9dc24f6420001c2","created_at":"2014-02-20T15:41:11+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-10T04:26:01+00:00","name":"Documentary Travel Photography","display_name":null,"description":"Since the invention of photography in the 1830s, artists have used their cameras to record their experiences abroad, often documenting unfamiliar places and cultures to share with their audiences back home.

In the 20th century, Sigmund Freud’s foundational text for psychoanalysis, _The Interpretation of Dreams_ (1900), sought to systematize the mysteries of dream symbolism, proving hugely influential to artists interested in the subconscious, such as the [Surrealists](/gene/surrealism).

Originally referring to a specific process of using heat to fuse beeswax with pigment and resin, encaustic has become a more general term for the use of wax and painting in tandem. Because of its durability, encaustic was most likely first used by the Greeks in order to waterproof and decorate ships, but eventually found its way into more traditional forms of art. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, where the medium appears in many religious icons, encaustic largely disappeared until the 18th century when it was used by artists trying to imitate Greek and Roman Art. In the 20th century, encaustic is most often associated with the work of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns), who used it in his Flag paintings, the first of which was displayed in 1955. Because of its versatility, other artists, such as [Martin Kline](/artist/martin-kline), [Brice Marden](/artist/brice-marden), and [Lynda Benglis](/artist/lynda-benglis), continued to work with encaustic throughout the 20th century and into the present day.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/7lF8gvUsC2um5KleJEDfHg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/7lF8gvUsC2um5KleJEDfHg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e3adafd4d76300001000722"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/encaustic"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e3adafd4d76300001000722"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e3adafd4d76300001000722&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e3adafd4d76300001000722"}}},{"id":"5266fe22275b24584d0002c4","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:37:22+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T03:39:09+00:00","name":"Endurance Art","display_name":null,"description":"Refers to artworks generally performed over a long period of time that may test the physical or emotional stamina of the artist or audience.

Taken upside-down, from the ground up (what Rodchenko, himself a pioneer of experimental photography, called a \"worm's eye view\"), from the sky (aerial views or \"bird's eye views\"), tilted (sometimes called the \"Batman angle\"), or rotated, photographs can enable us to see the world anew.

How one fails is a different matter.” —Luc Tuymans_\n\nMike Kelley famously claimed that he became an artist to embrace failure. In the 1980s, this irreverent attitude broke radically with the academicism of most previous movements, like [Minimalism](/gene/minimalism) and [Neo-Expressionism](/gene/neo-expressionism), whose artists were considered creative rebels. Unlike historical conceptions of failure as tragic or dramatic misfortune, contemporary artists have approached it as a banal occurrence, often filtered through irony, humor, vulnerability, or self-effacement. Failure has also come to be, paradoxically, a hallmark of artistic success.

In the 20th century, enabled by the rise of consumer culture and technologies of mass production like the sewing machine, factory-made prêt-à-porter (“ready to wear”) brought fashion into everyday life. Due to the reliance of fashion on commerce and its predominant association with women, its status as an art form worthy of serious scholarly attention has long been debated by art historians.

The painter should paint not only what he has in front of him, but also what he sees inside himself.” —Caspar David Friedrich_\n\nThe term “Rückenfigur” (“figure from the back”) comes from the 19th-century German [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism) movement. Popularized by artists such as [Caspar David Friedrich](/artist/caspar-david-friedrich), it describes paintings in which a figure is portrayed with his or her back toward the viewer, allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the figure’s perspective of the beholden scene and his or her emotional state. Despite concealing the face of the person portrayed, this form of portraiture is prevalent in contemporary paintings, film, photography, and even popular culture. Rückenfigur works ultimately achieve a paradoxical effect: while the subject’s pose invites the viewer into the scene, their turned back often communicates a mood of isolation or melancholy.

In Western Art, depictions of food date back to funerary paintings of food offerings in ancient Egypt. The Classical historian Pliny claimed that Greek painter Zeuxis once painted grapes so realistic that birds came to pick at them. Depictions continued in [Roman art](/gene/roman-art), where the putto (male infant) depicted with grape vines was a common motif. In [Baroque](/gene/baroque) painting, food appeared regularly as a still-life element, as exemplified by [Carravaggio](/artist/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio)'s _Bacchus_ or the _bodegones_ (meaning 'pantry still-lives') of Spanish painters [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) and [Francisco de Zurbarán](/artist/francisco-de-zurbaran). [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne)'s fruit still lifes presented new forms of representing three-dimensional space. In the 20th century, food was central to [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art)'s explorations of consumerism, as in [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol)'s Campell's soup cans, [Claes Oldenburg](/artist/claes-oldenburg)'s monumental hamburger and ice cream cone sculptures, and [Wayne Thiebaud](/artist/wayne-thiebaud)'s paintings of cakes and pastries. At its most logical extreme, food has been used as an actual medium for creating artworks, as in [Dieter Roth](/artist/dieter-roth)'s chocolate self-portraits and [Vik Muniz](/artist/vik-muniz)'s reproductions of iconic works of art using materials such as lunch meat and peanut butter.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/QuFB0uKCYz_T0On6vEau8Q/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/QuFB0uKCYz_T0On6vEau8Q/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4de7d8bf91b76c000100b370"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/food"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4de7d8bf91b76c000100b370"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4de7d8bf91b76c000100b370&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4de7d8bf91b76c000100b370"}}},{"id":"53d9818e7261690833f90300","created_at":"2014-07-30T23:36:46+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-14T09:43:28+00:00","name":"Found Footage and Found Video","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Nkzh7MT4Lwrpp9D3DxhipA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Nkzh7MT4Lwrpp9D3DxhipA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/53d9818e7261690833f90300"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/found-footage-and-found-video"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=53d9818e7261690833f90300"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=53d9818e7261690833f90300&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=53d9818e7261690833f90300"}}},{"id":"4f50f40ad9c50c027b1394b1","created_at":"2012-03-02T16:23:38+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-08T04:43:56+00:00","name":"Found Objects","display_name":null,"description":"Used to group works that include, or are predominantly constituted of, found objects.

Popular under the reign of Louis XIV, the French [Baroque](https://www.artsy.net/gene/baroque) style favored flamboyance over practicality, producing rigid structures embellished with elaborate wood carvings and gilded paneling. The [Rococo](https://www.artsy.net/artist/rococo) era of Louis XV—often considered France’s finest in terms of furniture design—was the first to prioritize comfort and usability, all while maintaining a sense of elegance through curving shapes and floral decorations. Influenced by the discovery of the ruins of Pompeii, French design entered its [Neoclassical](https://www.artsy.net/gene/neoclassicism) period under Louis XVI, characterized by a more restrained, geometric aesthetic. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the sinuous curves of [Art Nouveau](https://www.artsy.net/gene/art-nouveau) redefined France’s Metro stations, poster designs, and furniture pieces, though this style was soon replaced by [Art Deco](https://www.artsy.net/gene/art-deco) in the 1920s and 1930s.

After the First World War, the utopian and spiritual elements of this tendency gave way to the more political ideas of groups like the Dresden Secession and the Novembergruppe, many of whose members later became associated with [Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)](/gene/neue-sachlichkeit). Expressionism was a lightning-rod issue for Communists and National Socialists alike, for whom it often became a stand-in for Modern art at large.

Notable highlights of this transition include the late 19th-century movement [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau), including [posters](/gene/poster) by [Alphonse Mucha](/artist/alphonse-mucha) and [Jules Chéret](/artist/jules-cheret) that aimed to create a new aesthetic for the Industrial Age filled with sinuous forms and ornate typography. While graphic design today is more commonly considered a commercial activity, in the early 20th century it was closely aligned with fine art, especially in the journals of avant-garde artists (for example, [Filippo Tommaso Marinetti](/artist/filippo-tommaso-marinetti)’s Futurist publications, Tristan Tzara’s Dada, [Theo Van Doesburg](/artist/theo-van-doesburg-1)’s Stijl, and [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)’s Merz). These experiments helped pave the way for the clarity, legibility, and dominant planes of bright colors typical of the International Typographic Style (or Swiss Style), developed in the 1950s. This aesthetic permeates advertising and logo design today, from Adidas’s striking three-bar logo to IBM’s three simple letters. The accessibility of ever-evolving digital tools has dramatically democratized the field of graphic design and opened a new platform for the discipline: designing for the web.\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/RY3KlfwsebaAwADAlx2nkw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/RY3KlfwsebaAwADAlx2nkw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/52d9a44ba6ca6d9f450000b0"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/graphic-design"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=52d9a44ba6ca6d9f450000b0"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=52d9a44ba6ca6d9f450000b0&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=52d9a44ba6ca6d9f450000b0"}}},{"id":"5048da523403ed0002000202","created_at":"2012-09-06T17:16:02+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:41+00:00","name":"Greece","display_name":"Greek Art","description":"Artists who are from or who have lived in Greece.

Greek Art’s [Geometric period](/tag/geometric-period) is characterized by geometric designs and stylized [figures](/gene/silhouettes) painted on the bodies of pottery [vessels](/gene/vessel). Beginning in the seventh century BCE, the Archaic period witnessed the introduction of the human marble statuary as a vehicle for the production of images of idealized youth, known as the [kouros](/tag/kouros) and [kore](/tag/kore). During the Classical period, artists further refined sculptures of the human figure to reflect a canon of ideal beauty: [Praxiteles](/artist/praxiteles)’s _[Aphrodite of Knidos](/artwork/praxiteles-aphrodite-of-knidos-greco-roman-variant-on-the-original-marble-of-ca-350-bc)_ would become one of the Greek statues most reproduced in the Hellenistic period and later by the Romans, who heavily copied and emulated Greek artworks and styles. While one trend within Hellenistic art adhered to the idealism of Classical models, another involved a shift to depictions of [human drama](/artwork/dying-gaul-gallic-trumpeter-from-commemorative-group-at-pergamum-in-asia-minor-1) and genre-like figures. Greek architecture reached its apogee in the so-called golden century of Pericles at the height of Athenian democracy, with the creation of the [Parthenon](/artwork/kallikrates-and-iktinos-parthenon-acropolis), a temple in honor of goddess [Athena](/tag/athena) (built by [Kallikrates and Iktinos](/artist/kallikrates-and-iktinos) between 447 to 432 BCE).

These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange. Under the Roman Empire (27 BC-395 AD), territories stretching from the present-day Middle East to Scotland were brought under centralized rule. Beginning in the 4th century, cultural and political power shifted to the east of the empire, with Constantinople becoming the capital in 330 and much of the western territory falling into the hands of northern European conquerors thereafter. Around this time, Christianity began to supplant pagan religion—at first persecuted by the state but in the 4th century becoming the official religion under Constantine, which led to the growth of a new body of iconography that would flourish in [Byzantine Art](/gene/byzantine-art).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/QaeCaYY2JmfhAxz0eZSDnA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/QaeCaYY2JmfhAxz0eZSDnA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/51f7df77275b246a330002fc"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/greek-and-roman-art-and-architecture"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=51f7df77275b246a330002fc"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=51f7df77275b246a330002fc&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=51f7df77275b246a330002fc"}}},{"id":"4e1b05137082620001000019","created_at":"2011-07-11T14:13:39+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-30T13:03:30+00:00","name":"Grid","display_name":null,"description":"A general category for both two- and three-dimensional artworks incorporating a grid or lattice structure in some fashion.

Using everything from mud and Elmer’s glue to plastic tubing and sound art, these artists strove to create new, vital experiences that blurred the boundaries between art and life. Early experiments, such as [Kazuo Shiraga](/artist/kazuo-shiraga)’s calligraphic paintings made by smearing paint around on a canvas, evoking the gestural abstraction of [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock) or [Art Informel](/gene/art-informel), were soon followed by an emphasis on performances, immersive installations, and video. For a nation recently defeated in World War II and emerging from the shadow of totalitarianism, Gutai’s call for vitality, play, and new artistic frontiers served as a jolt to a culture of consensus. The group actively promoted itself abroad through the distribution of mail art and a well-circulated journal, and in 1958 prominent New York dealer Martha Jackson staged an exhibition of their work. Gutai’s focus on performance and materiality has often been cited as a precursor to [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera) and [performance art](/gene/performance-art) of the 1960s.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Iavka4P881nXQpcBGVVfvg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Iavka4P881nXQpcBGVVfvg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4d90d191dcdd5f44a500004a"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/gutai"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4d90d191dcdd5f44a500004a"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4d90d191dcdd5f44a500004a&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4d90d191dcdd5f44a500004a"}}},{"id":"54889e9272616903774d0100","created_at":"2014-12-10T19:27:14+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:34+00:00","name":"Han Dynasty","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/PTFowSkjaeZPGNUowUfnxA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/PTFowSkjaeZPGNUowUfnxA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/54889e9272616903774d0100"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/han-dynasty"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=54889e9272616903774d0100"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=54889e9272616903774d0100&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=54889e9272616903774d0100"}}},{"id":"50ac180d986f93da5a0007c4","created_at":"2012-11-20T23:53:49+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T13:36:21+00:00","name":"Handcrafted Furniture and Design","display_name":null,"description":"Handcrafted furniture and design draw upon traditional craft materials and methods, such as woodworking, ceramics, textiles, and metalwork.

Over centuries, Hindu temple structures have evolved from rock caves carved into cliffs to large monuments with symbolically multifaceted spaces. As cultural traditions changed rapidly in the late 19th century, artist Ravi Varma pioneered the use of color lithography to mass-produce his Western-influenced paintings of Hindu deities, subjects that contemporary Indian painter [Manjit Bawa](/artist/manjit-bawa) also later depicted, referring to them as “icons of my country.”","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/xOMFlPr9t9CGc9DeTXThvQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/xOMFlPr9t9CGc9DeTXThvQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/509843847d77920002001578"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/hindu-art-and-architecture"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=509843847d77920002001578"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=509843847d77920002001578&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=509843847d77920002001578"}}},{"id":"50a14b03509ee8ebb8000f7b","created_at":"2012-11-12T19:16:19+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-01T16:09:15+00:00","name":"History Painting","display_name":null,"description":"A genre of [painting](/gene/painting) that was influential from the mid-[15th century](/gene/15th-century) through the [19th century](/gene/19th-century).

Gesture, grimace, clothing, decor even—all must combine to realize a character.” —Charles Baudelaire_\n\nIndividual portraiture—the likeness of a single person—has long been one of the most popular forms of art. Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait. Artists continue today to reconcile the traditional means of portraiture with photography.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/CnuuiLsSNITiZQ1dAHpNHw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/CnuuiLsSNITiZQ1dAHpNHw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e5708cb5dca140001003aa3"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/individual-portrait"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e5708cb5dca140001003aa3"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e5708cb5dca140001003aa3&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e5708cb5dca140001003aa3"}}},{"id":"505cc1a092a60b00020009d2","created_at":"2012-09-21T19:36:00+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-07T00:16:31+00:00","name":"Indonesian Art","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Naw9Kb9cMV-VJ9uxtls7PA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Naw9Kb9cMV-VJ9uxtls7PA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/505cc1a092a60b00020009d2"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/indonesian-art"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=505cc1a092a60b00020009d2"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=505cc1a092a60b00020009d2&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=505cc1a092a60b00020009d2"}}},{"id":"54c7cfaa7261692b6e200600","created_at":"2015-01-27T17:49:30+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:13+00:00","name":"Industrial and Product Design","display_name":null,"description":"Industrial design/product design, which describes mass-produced, often machine-made objects and interfaces designed for human needs, has been a fruitful area of collaboration between art and commerce and designers, artists, engineers, and architects since well before the term was coined in the 1920s. The industrial revolution, beginning in the late 18th century, introduced increasingly complex machinery that fundamentally altered the production, circulation, and consumption of goods. Throughout the mid-20th century, material innovations, the inventive repurposing of World War II manufacturing processes, and an ethos of collaboration among artists and designers yielded a high point in design history. For example, the bent plywood technique used in Charles and Ray Eames’s [iconic chair](/artwork/charles-and-ray-eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman-2) originated in a leg splint they designed for the Navy. Designers used methods of ethnography, anthropology, anthropometry, ergonomics, and the study of the body and movement to bring human-centered design to the masses (Henry Dreyfuss’s 1937 [Model 203 Telephone](/artwork/henry-dreyfuss-model-302-telephone) was the first to enable hands-free calling; [Dieter Rams](/artist/dieter-rams)’s 1987 Braun calculator influenced the look of the iPhone’s calculator). After World War II, increased purchasing power in the United States and Europe contributed to the flourishing of designing for human needs, while the development of computing technology in the later 20th century has led to innovations in product design, particularly responsive user interfaces.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TYDaZWQUgXVki9t3_L6ycg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/TYDaZWQUgXVki9t3_L6ycg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/54c7cfaa7261692b6e200600"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/industrial-and-product-design"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=54c7cfaa7261692b6e200600"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=54c7cfaa7261692b6e200600&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=54c7cfaa7261692b6e200600"}}},{"id":"4ef3a93834c5a800010010ff","created_at":"2011-12-22T22:03:36+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-28T20:31:02+00:00","name":"Industry","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks depicting sites of industry and manufacturing, such as factories.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Gygr8jdob2KAkm1CGvUFtA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Gygr8jdob2KAkm1CGvUFtA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4ef3a93834c5a800010010ff"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/industry"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4ef3a93834c5a800010010ff"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4ef3a93834c5a800010010ff&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4ef3a93834c5a800010010ff"}}},{"id":"4e84a8f5be468f00010020c8","created_at":"2011-09-29T17:20:53+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:07+00:00","name":"Infographics and Diagrams","display_name":null,"description":"Shortened form of \"Information graphics,\" which are visual representations of information.

Turn aside the canals to flood the museums!” The term “institutional critique,” however, has come to designate a strand of conceptual art beginning in the 1960s and associated with [Michael Asher](/artist/michael-asher), [Marcel Broodthaers](/artist/marcel-broodthaers), [Daniel Buren](/artist/daniel-buren), and [Hans Haacke](/artist/hans-haacke). These artists sought to expose the ideologies and power structures underlying the circulation, display, and discussion of art. In his seminal 1972 work _the eagle from the Oligocene to the present_, for example, Broodthaers brought together 266 found objects and displayed a wall text alongside each one that read “This is not a work of art,” thus questioning museums’ role in exhibiting and conferring status to artworks, as well as the role of the artist as the maker of original artworks.

Artists who take intersectionality as their focus are interested in the way that different types of discrimination—such as racism, classism, xenophobia, misogyny, or ageism—can converge and impact individuals and groups, and their work explores these complex interactions.

While Islam shares the prophetic tradition of Judaism and Christianity, the monotheistic religion has its own tenets and rituals, such as the belief in Allah as the one god and Muhammad as his prophet, daily prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and, if possible, a pilgrimage to Mecca. However, Islamic art is difficult to define: not all Islamic art is religious, and not all artists who created it were Muslim. Islamic art includes [architecture](/gene/architecture-1), [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), decorative arts ([carpets](/artwork/turkey-ottoman-prayer-rug), ceramics, and metalware, among other examples), and [painting](/gene/painting) and stems from territories as diverse as the Arab world: Iranian lands, Turkey, India, China, and Spain.

Over time, Islamic art developed a unique artistic language whose hallmarks included all-over decoration and the use of vegetal and geometric patterns, such as the [Arabesque](/gene/arabesque-slash-scroll), among other forms. As writing is highly valued in Islam, calligraphy is ubiquitous, serving as decoration for objects and buildings. Additionally, while figuration is found in secular examples of Islamic Art, it is absent from religious works, in which the depiction of the human form is considered idolatry.

Sourced from established Italian fashion houses and niche production factories like Alessi and Cassina that specialize in areas like flatware, lighting, or seating, Italy's modern design industry has been centralized in Milan and Northern Italy.

Emmanuele Ponzio's Pillola Lamps (1968).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SFC-VHJnus10hXJ_79NKUQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SFC-VHJnus10hXJ_79NKUQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/51a7a6c5275b24a8f700037c"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/italian-furniture-and-design"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=51a7a6c5275b24a8f700037c"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=51a7a6c5275b24a8f700037c&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=51a7a6c5275b24a8f700037c"}}},{"id":"4e603764e890b10001261599","created_at":"2011-09-02T01:54:44+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T13:36:31+00:00","name":"Italy","display_name":"Italian Art","description":"Artists who are from or who have lived in Italy.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/jYLnmevcoVlzRewHzghFlg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/jYLnmevcoVlzRewHzghFlg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e603764e890b10001261599"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/italy"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e603764e890b10001261599"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e603764e890b10001261599&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e603764e890b10001261599"}}},{"id":"50a3c40292e5b977b70006ad","created_at":"2012-11-14T16:17:06+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:44+00:00","name":"Ivory","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks and design objects that include what is technically known as dentine, a material that comes from the tusks of elephants, as well as other mammals.

Led by photographers [Kansuke Yamamoto](/artist/kansuke-yamamoto) and Hiroshi Hamaya, Japanese photography of the 1920s and 1930s was largely shaped by the emergence of documentary photography in the United States and by established strains of Western [Pictorialism](/gene/pictorialism) and [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism). Post–World War II Japanese photography was dominated by street photographers [Daido Moriyama](/artist/daido-moriyama), Osamu Kanemura, and Yakuma Nakahir, who used handheld cameras to capture the frenzied claustrophobia of daily life in urban Japan. Such photographers pursued a new photographic form, termed _sunappu shotto_ (“[snapshot](/gene/snapshot-aesthetic”), which was characterized by the aesthetics of rough, blurred, and out of focus images. As photography galleries arrived relatively late to Japan, photography magazines like _Camera Mainichi_, _Asahi Camera_, and most famously _PROVOKE_, as well the medium of the photobook, were integral to the medium’s development and popularity. Other significant figures in post-war and contemporary Japanese photography include [Hiroshi Sugimoto](/artist/hiroshi-sugimoto), [Nobuyoshi Araki](/artist/nobuyoshi-araki), and [Hiroshi Masaki](/artist/hiroshi-masaki).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ehMtxJeU07LvIVCGCQ1Xmg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ehMtxJeU07LvIVCGCQ1Xmg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/544568727261691bc67f0100"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/japanese-photography"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=544568727261691bc67f0100"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=544568727261691bc67f0100&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=544568727261691bc67f0100"}}},{"id":"4db85c704f6b2471d7000081","created_at":"2011-04-27T18:12:00+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-11T11:07:19+00:00","name":"Japonisme","display_name":null,"description":"Generally refers to the Japanese influence on many European artists in the later part of the 19th century, as evidenced in the incorporation of Japanese designs into decorative objects, the depiction of scenes set in Japan, and the various stylistic influences of Japanese aesthetics. After a long period of isolation, Japan resumed trade with the West in 1853, and Japanese goods soon began to pour into Europe. Japanese objects were especially fashionable in Paris and London, and the term Japonisme was coined in 1872 by Parisian critic Phillippe Burty, whose vast collection of Japanese artworks drew the attention of [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) and numerous Impressionists. Japanese aesthetics, as exemplified by _Ukiyo-e_ (\"Pictures of the Floating World\"), inspired asymmetric compositions, flattened modeling, calligraphic brushstrokes, pure bright colors, and the representation of transient, everyday scenes. These tendencies are visible in works of [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), as well as Nabis painters [Pierre Bonnard](/artist/pierre-bonnard) and [Édouard Vuillard](/artist/edouard-vuillard); [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) was inspired by Kabuki theatre prints, while [Paul Gauguin](/artist/paul-gauguin) adapted Japanese woodcut techniques. In England, [James Abbott McNeill Whister](/artist/james-abbott-mcneill-whistler) was Japonisme's most vigorous proponent.

In the 20th century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, the term has become more generally associated with mass commodities or cheap entertainment, considered decorative or evocative of lowbrow taste. Kitsch suffered its most serious intellectual blow in art circles when Clement Greenberg railed against it in a famous 1939 essay, in which he claimed it anathema to progressive, avant-garde art since it pandered to the masses. The rise of consumerism in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and '60s generated an artistic interest in popular culture, however, often with an eye towards dismantling the divide between ostensibly “fine art” and mass appeal; nowhere was this more notable than with the rise of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) in the United States. Today, the idea that something can be “so bad it’s good” is so common that the term “kitsch” no longer retains the negative associations it once did, and artists today often create works that embrace bad taste and question the high- and lowbrow division in art.

The technique involves drawing directly on flat stone with an oil-based implement, then coating the stone with a water-based liquid. The applied marks repel the liquid, so that when oil-based ink is applied to the stone it fills in the image, allowing it to be transferred onto a sheet. Since the [19th century](/gene/19th-century), lithography has been widely used by commercial and fine artists as a means to mass-produce images, maps, and texts. It was explored early on by [Eugène Delacroix](/artist/eugene-victor-ferdinand-delacroix-eugene-delacroix) and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier), but it was artists in the latter half of the 19th century who unleashed the medium with bold experimentation. [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) and [Édouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet) took to the stone with a marked freedom, depicting motion and fleeting effects of light, while [Pierre Bonnard](/artist/pierre-bonnard) and [Édouard Vuillard](/artist/edouard-vuillard) infused the rich, natural colors of Impressionist pastels and [oil paintings](/gene/oil-painting) into their lithograph prints.

Northern Renaissance, Impressionist, and Fauvist artists, such as [Henri Matisse](https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse), frequently depicted scenes through windows to mediate and direct the viewer’s attention or to play with the idea of a painting as a “window onto the world,” a convention that has existed since the invention of one-point perspective. Perhaps the most famous example from art history is [Marcel Duchamp](https://www.artsy.net/artist/marcel-duchamp)’s Étant donnés (1946–66), an unsettling diorama of a female nude sprawled over a landscape. The sculpture itself is situated behind what appears to be a wooden door in a wall of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the only way to see the scene is to look through a tiny slit in the door. \n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/0cSEwTRlmNT1gt5voesUlw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/0cSEwTRlmNT1gt5voesUlw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5473a50a72616956777c0100"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/mediated-view"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5473a50a72616956777c0100"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5473a50a72616956777c0100&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5473a50a72616956777c0100"}}},{"id":"4dcdf9e7522d6e00010042d0","created_at":"2011-05-14T03:41:27+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-27T07:47:40+00:00","name":"Medical/Health","display_name":null,"description":"Used in describing artworks related to health or medical institutions or issues.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/cxbxM1zf1eHr-toPA88x4w/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/cxbxM1zf1eHr-toPA88x4w/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4dcdf9e7522d6e00010042d0"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/medical-slash-health"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4dcdf9e7522d6e00010042d0"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4dcdf9e7522d6e00010042d0&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4dcdf9e7522d6e00010042d0"}}},{"id":"4f19e3feebab7d00010001e6","created_at":"2012-01-20T22:00:30+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-24T14:50:20+00:00","name":"Medieval Art","display_name":null,"description":"A term encompassing the wide variety of art and architecture produced during the Middle Ages, a prolonged period of economic and social stagnation in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean that spanned roughly from the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD to the early stages of the [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) (1400s).

Photography","display_name":null,"description":"A general term used to encompass trends in photography from roughly 1910-1950 when photographers began to produce works with a sharp focus and an emphasis on formal qualities, exploiting, rather than obscuring, the camera as an essentially mechanical and technological tool. Also referred to as Modernist Photography, this approach abandoned the [Pictorialist](/gene/pictorialism) mode that had dominated the medium for over 50 years throughout the United States, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Critic Sadakichi Hartmann’s 1904 “Plea for a Straight Photography” heralded this new approach, rejecting the artistic manipulations, soft focus, and painterly quality of Pictorialism and praising the straightforward, unadulterated images of modern life in the work of artists such as Alfred Stieglitz. Innovators like [Paul Strand](/artist/paul-strand) and [Edward Weston](/artist/edward-weston) would further expand the artistic capabilities and techniques of photography, helping to establish it as an independent art form.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/HeFJMKhzYOYps-J_DGdWsw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/HeFJMKhzYOYps-J_DGdWsw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4db5d4fb4197407c12000938"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/modern-photography"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4db5d4fb4197407c12000938"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4db5d4fb4197407c12000938&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4db5d4fb4197407c12000938"}}},{"id":"536ba17ccb4c27792500010d","created_at":"2014-05-08T15:23:40+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-12T12:24:03+00:00","name":"Modern and Contemporary Design","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wwvUKc6s6srRu1hfpRzoVA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/wwvUKc6s6srRu1hfpRzoVA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/536ba17ccb4c27792500010d"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/modern-and-contemporary-design"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=536ba17ccb4c27792500010d"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=536ba17ccb4c27792500010d&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=536ba17ccb4c27792500010d"}}},{"id":"5601ac66726169116c00009a","created_at":"2015-09-22T19:30:46+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:38+00:00","name":"Modern and Contemporary Fashion Design","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/U-kf3pq5sGra45tS__ItzQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/U-kf3pq5sGra45tS__ItzQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5601ac66726169116c00009a"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/modern-and-contemporary-fashion-design"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5601ac66726169116c00009a"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5601ac66726169116c00009a&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5601ac66726169116c00009a"}}},{"id":"50356574ab74980002000006","created_at":"2012-08-22T23:04:20+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-12T12:35:20+00:00","name":"Modern and Impressionist Art","display_name":null,"description":"_\"Most painting in the European tradition was painting the mask.

Perhaps the earliest known portrait in China, from approximately 160 B.C.E., is a [funeral banner](/artwork/painted-banner-tomb-of-the-marquess-of-dai-mawangdui-changsha-hunan-han-dynasty) for the noblewoman Lady Dai. In [Christian Art](/gene/christian-art-and-architecture), the iconography of the [Lamentation](/tag/lamentation)—a group of figures grieving the death of Christ—was popular from the 11th through the 19th century, and the [Pietà](/tag/pieta) (the Virgin Mary mourning a dead Christ) was a common motif from the 13th through the 17th century. Modern, largely secular works about mourning often present sites for social memorializing of public figures or groups. These often take the form of figurative sculptures of specific individuals, such as Auguste Rodin’s _[Monument to Balzac](/artwork/auguste-rodin-monument-to-honore-de-balzac)_ (1891–7), though others explore mourning through abstraction, such as [Maya Lin](/artist/maya-lin)’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C., which offers an immersive environment for visitors to pay tribute to the American soldiers who lost their lives in the Vietnam War.

The Swiss artist Max Bill, a major exponent of Concrete Art, had significant exhibitions in São Paulo, Brazil in the early 1950s, inspiring a younger generation of artists there. In 1959, the _Neo-Concrete Manifesto_ was written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro—including [Lygia Clark](/artist/lygia-clark), [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica), and Lygia Pape—who shared a similar interest in abstract forms and the use of color but wanted to insert poetic, and sometimes political, meaning and a greater sense of freedom and flexibility into their work. The merging of art and life was crucial: painting was to be removed from its frame, sculpture taken down from its pedestal, and the work constantly subject to re-invention by its viewers. This led to developments in participatory and immersive art, as exemplified by Oiticica's penetrable environments and wearable sculptures or Pape's envisioning of a world without words in _Book of Creation_. The critic Ronaldo Brito called Neo-Concrete Art a \"rupture\" in Brazilian art history, one that would inspire later generations of artists in Brazil, including those practicing under the repressive military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Ha1nqZ2HkWwQ64lYJSZMYg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Ha1nqZ2HkWwQ64lYJSZMYg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5037e4597b18740002000c43"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/neo-concrete-art"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5037e4597b18740002000c43"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5037e4597b18740002000c43&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5037e4597b18740002000c43"}}},{"id":"4d90d191dcdd5f44a5000058","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2017-10-08T20:19:07+00:00","name":"Neo-Dada","display_name":null,"description":"A style appearing in the United States in the late 1950s that in its methods and concerns recalls [Dada](/gene/dada), whose ideas were introduced to American artists by the composer John Cage.

Rejecting the individualistic, emotional tenor of the then dominant [German and Austrian Expressionism](/gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism), the style harnessed the power of the \"mutual relation of forms,\" which could express a spiritual, even transcendental harmony. The universal and lasting purity achieved at the intersection of horizontal and vertical acted as a hopeful opportunity for wholeness and redemption after the nightmare of World War One. And aesthetically, the pared-down essentialism and flat, geometric sensibility of Neo-Plasticism would, like [Constructivism](/gene/constructivism), prove significant across several mediums and movements, like [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus), [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art), [Purism](/gene/purism), and later American abstraction.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/2emRcYwLuhkihc7Q0-8HTQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/2emRcYwLuhkihc7Q0-8HTQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5045166c0827c100020000b7"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/neo-plasticism"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5045166c0827c100020000b7"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5045166c0827c100020000b7&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5045166c0827c100020000b7"}}},{"id":"4f4bf180fe950c0001001909","created_at":"2012-02-27T21:11:28+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-06T08:14:22+00:00","name":"Neoclassicism","display_name":null,"description":"Mid-18th-century to mid-19th-century artworks strongly influenced by ancient Greek and Roman art, particularly for its compositional order and simplification of imagery.

Canvas was seen as a preferable support due to wood's tendency to split and warp over time, and while it has its own drawbacks (including a more intensive priming process) has proved a more stable ground for paintings.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/8RLunNOW4cIEhYP4tjYYUA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/8RLunNOW4cIEhYP4tjYYUA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/50f07a99b768a08bfd0000a2"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/oil-on-panel"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=50f07a99b768a08bfd0000a2"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=50f07a99b768a08bfd0000a2&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=50f07a99b768a08bfd0000a2"}}},{"id":"505cc2a767ad450002000a23","created_at":"2012-09-21T19:40:23+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:42:36+00:00","name":"Oku Art","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/vBLj4hnhgkTNJLNIhTEkWA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/vBLj4hnhgkTNJLNIhTEkWA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/505cc2a767ad450002000a23"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/oku-art"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=505cc2a767ad450002000a23"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=505cc2a767ad450002000a23&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=505cc2a767ad450002000a23"}}},{"id":"4ebc3cc74f1217000100424b","created_at":"2011-11-10T21:06:15+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-26T23:29:35+00:00","name":"Old Master Drawings and Prints","display_name":null,"description":"A general category for drawings and prints created by prominent artists working from the Renaissance through the end of the 18th century.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SLK2xnehwaGWvrSvej51gQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/SLK2xnehwaGWvrSvej51gQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4ebc3cc74f1217000100424b"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/old-master-drawings-and-prints"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4ebc3cc74f1217000100424b"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4ebc3cc74f1217000100424b&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4ebc3cc74f1217000100424b"}}},{"id":"564fa5b5864d8267380003e2","created_at":"2015-11-20T22:59:01+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-30T14:23:28+00:00","name":"Old Master Influenced Fantasy","display_name":null,"description":"Surreal or fantastical contemporary paintings whose imagery and style is reminiscent of the costumes, settings, and color schemes found in paintings of the [Old Masters](/gene/old-masters).

For example, the [Pattern and Decoration](/gene/pattern-and-decoration) movement of the 1970s rejected the austere aesthetics of [Minimalism](/gene/minimalism) and [Conceptual Art](/gene/conceptual-art) through the use of extensive, allover ornamentation. In contemporary art, vibrant patterns appear in the works of [Damien Hirst](/artist/damien-hirst), [Phillip Taaffe](/artist/philip-taaffe), [Fred Tomaselli](/artist/fred-tomaselli), and [Sarah Morris](/artist/sarah-morris), among countless others.\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/l-Wj-G9fNPuN_Li0yi2Dyg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/l-Wj-G9fNPuN_Li0yi2Dyg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e5ffebe1bb9170001001566"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/patterns"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e5ffebe1bb9170001001566"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e5ffebe1bb9170001001566&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e5ffebe1bb9170001001566"}}},{"id":"50b98fba0a77d5469100011f","created_at":"2012-12-01T05:03:54+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-27T18:23:20+00:00","name":"People at Home","display_name":null,"description":"A general category for depictions of human beings in the various rooms of the home.

In 1916 the linguist Ferdinand Saussure proposed that the form a language takes is arbitrary and unrelated to its meaning. A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning. Since then, artists have developed personal systems of pictograms and glyphs with varying degrees of legibility and idiosyncrasy, often to explore a wide range of concepts. In the 1960s, for example, [A.R. Penck](/artist/ar-penck) drew inspiration from cybernetics, the study of systems, to derive a hieroglyphic-like system of signs, which he used to represent societal and metaphysical relationships. In the 1980s, [Gu Wenda](/artist/wenda-gu) developed a system of meaningless ideograms that resemble traditional [Chinese calligraphy](/gene/east-asian-calligraphy).

Retaining their prominence in art of medieval Europe, personifications also appeared extensively in allegorical works of the European [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) and [Baroque](/gene/baroque) period.

Picasso later drew on these principles while employing bright colors and curvilinear forms, flattening his figures to create striking portraits with seemingly distorted facial features. It is nearly impossible to catalogue the myriad ways that artists have created stylistically similar works: in the 1910s, artists like [Albert Gleizes](/artist/albert-gleizes) and [Jean Metzinger](/artist/jean-metzinger) adapted Picasso’s mature Cubist style.

Since concrete can be poured and metal can be bent into any shape, many architects have taken advantage of this versatile and cost-effective material to construct complex structures. Beginning in the early 20th century, the Belgian architect Auguste Perret (with the help of his brothers, Gustave and Claude) built the world’s first reinforced concrete apartment block at 25 rue Franklin, in Paris. The unparalleled strength of reinforced concrete meant that fewer structural supports were needed, which allowed Perret to use large windows on the facade to let in more light and to create more open space on each floor. Many iconic buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries have since been built using reinforced concrete construction, including [Frank Lloyd Wright](/artist/frank-lloyd/wright)’s Solomon R.

For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances.

Some have traced its attitude and focus on destruction to the [Dada](/gene/dada) movement of the early 20th century, understanding it as a type of anti-art disdaining visual and cultural norms as gatekeepers to participation. Many of punk’s founders came from working class backgrounds, and some explicitly aligned punk with this group’s political interests, an alliance that posed a particular challenge to punk’s relationship to fine art, traditionally the realm of high culture.

The French artist [Arman](/artist/arman) and American sculptor [Dustin Yellin](/artist/dustin-yellin) have both suspended found objects in clear resin, creating works that seem to defy the laws of gravity.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/RUpJIehlKxZ4xKF71UhvZw/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/RUpJIehlKxZ4xKF71UhvZw/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/50b2a215379926bef6000057"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/resin"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=50b2a215379926bef6000057"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=50b2a215379926bef6000057&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=50b2a215379926bef6000057"}}},{"id":"552302f57261696f54c53800","created_at":"2015-04-06T22:04:37+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-21T04:34:47+00:00","name":"Restored and Repurposed","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks or objects whose original form has been significantly altered as a result of heavy restoration or in an effort to repurpose it for a new use.

In medieval art, portable objects were often refitted, at times after being dismembered, in new settings in an effort to embellish the display of a revered object or give it a new function entirely.

For example, prior to the 20th century, Japan had a long history of sitting on the floor.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/4HoBDfLXgYFsuPydEBTymg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/4HoBDfLXgYFsuPydEBTymg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/51aca202700006a03a000027"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/seating"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=51aca202700006a03a000027"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=51aca202700006a03a000027&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=51aca202700006a03a000027"}}},{"id":"50f077cb5c4d5614ff00007f","created_at":"2013-01-11T20:36:27+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:10+00:00","name":"Seduction and Courtship","display_name":null,"description":"Throughout history, perhaps no other activity has preoccupied cultures as much as the cycle of courtship, seduction, and marriage—what Shakespeare summed up as \"wooing, wedding, and repenting.\" It is no surprise that art the world over has depicted and dissected the often complex social mores and rituals that accompany this pursuit, and those particularly adept at it—from Don Juan to the Troubadours—have become household names.

Koons’ polish—such as in his monumental balloon animals—has been associated with ideas of narcissism and newness, both consistent themes in his work.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Bzm0dIt1oHApILEHRjryzA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/Bzm0dIt1oHApILEHRjryzA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e0ce7dde066dd00010038a9"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/shiny-slash-glossy"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e0ce7dde066dd00010038a9"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e0ce7dde066dd00010038a9&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e0ce7dde066dd00010038a9"}}},{"id":"507c497581f5960002001a71","created_at":"2012-10-15T17:35:49+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T13:36:22+00:00","name":"Side Chair","display_name":null,"description":"A chair without arms, meant for the side of a [table](/gene/table).

The term was eventually used to describe backlit images, such as figures or objects in front of a sunset or in a window or a doorway. Despite its etymological origins in the 19th century, the silhouette can be used to describe the black-and-red figure technique in some ancient Greek vase painting.

By 1979, an entire spray-paint industry had developed, with over 270 million cans being sold annually in the United States. This rise coincided with the prominence of graffiti art in the 1970s, a form centered in New York City. Spray paint was portable, affordable, and easy to use, making it the medium of choice for the illegal activity. Some early practitioners of graffiti art included Lady Pink, CRASH, Lee Quinones, and Fab 5 Freddy. In the 1990s and 2000s, contemporary graffiti artists such as [Shepard Fairey](https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey) and [Banksy](https://www.artsy.net/artist/banksy) built on these earlier artists’ work. Galleries began showing graffiti paintings in the 1980s, and since then spray paint has been increasingly used by non-graffiti artists, including Peter Peri, Blue and Joy, Rita Ackermann, and Jaybo Monk, often in combination with other materials and techniques. Spray paint has a noticeable aesthetic, void of brushstrokes, and many application techniques, including burns, fades, and flares. Depending on the amount of pressure painters apply to the nozzle and the time they spend in a particular spot, spray-paint lines can be thin, thick, layered, splattered, and/or dripped.

Historically in the West a very popular genre of painting, still life works can be traced back to antiquity, and often provide keys to understanding cultures of different eras and regions. In the Middle Ages, still life painting was adapted to serve a religious purpose, with items like lilies, coral, and fruit playing various allegorical roles. The Dutch and Flemish Golden Age carried on the allegorical tradition in still life paintings, proving to be the most prolific time for the genre. In addition to giving new life to the opulent table settings of the Netherlandish elite, still life paintings showcased cultural advancements in botanical and scientific discoveries. The genre continued to evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was not until the radical Modernist shift during the first half of the 20th century that still life painting took on new meaning.

Notable early street photographers include [Paul Strand](/artist/paul-strand) and [Walker Evans](/artist/walker-evans), whose portraits of immigrants and the urban poor continue to shape our image of New York in the early 20th century. The New York Photo League, founded in 1936 by a group of socially conscious photographers, chronicled the gritty realities of urban life, and in so doing exposed both the vibrancy and diversity of the city and the plight and suffering of ordinary people. Such work rejected the cool formalism of modern photography, and increasingly in the 1960s—through the work of [Garry Winogrand](/artist/garry-winogrand) and [Lee Friedlander](/artist/lee-friedlander)—became associated with the snapshot aesthetic.

Rather than providing concrete depictions of the afterlife, Hirst’s works imply that mankind experiences a continually present living death.

The 19th century saw the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the First Transcontinental Railroad (1869) greatly extend the reach of American settlement, access to natural resources, and lines of commerce. Far beyond its economic implications, however, the American West was a national mythology—a site of wilderness, exploration, and lawless freedom that for many represented the path to the American dream and a belief in Manifest Destiny. While this collective history brings national pride for many, westward expansion also saw its most brutal forms in the massive displacement and killing of Native Americans. Since the early 19th century artists have documented the exploration of frontier lands, as in [Carleton Emmons Watkins](/artist/carleton-emmons-watkins)’ iconic views of Yosemite National Park or [William Henry Jackson](/artist/william-henry-jackson)’s framing of the transcontinental railroad tunneling through mountains. Others, like [Frederic Remington](/artist/frederic-remington), romanticized its inhabitants through loose renderings of horsemen, cavalrymen, Native Americans, or [cowboys](/tag/cowboy)—from Andy Warhol’s depiction of [John Wayne](/artwork/andy-warhol-john-wayne) to [Richard Prince](/artist/richard-prince)’s appropriation of the iconic cowboy from Marlboro cigarette advertisements.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/IYT-_1GzqN3ikbhNnEF00g/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/IYT-_1GzqN3ikbhNnEF00g/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/53276118c9dc24904900077f"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/the-american-west"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=53276118c9dc24904900077f"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=53276118c9dc24904900077f&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=53276118c9dc24904900077f"}}},{"id":"4fc659af5a9a240001000bae","created_at":"2012-05-30T17:32:31+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-10T10:24:53+00:00","name":"The Art Market","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks that focus on the art market, oftentimes with an element of critique.

While Oehlen, Kippenberger, and the Freiheit group had widely varied concerns and approaches, these artists are often noted for their relationship to the New Wave and punk scenes, along with their brash attitudes that attacked bourgeois values and the decade’s perceived political apathy. Importantly, the prevalence of figuration and gestural brushwork has led many to label these works [Neo-Expressionist](/gene/neo-expressionism) in style.

Mostly self-trained, the Stars championed individualism and freedom of expression both in their work and public activities. Taking personal experience and social issues as their subject matter, they pointedly diverged from state-sanctioned [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism). The group’s members made history in 1979 when they defied government regulation and mounted an unofficial exhibition in a park adjacent to the National Art Museum in Beijing. When officials closed the exhibition, the group staged a historic protest that became a rallying point for cultural openness in the early years of China’s post–Cultural Revolution political thaw; significantly, they succeeded in reopening the exhibition. The group went on to stage a second public exhibition, though their activities tapered off in the early 1980s, when many members emigrated abroad. The group’s legacy can be seen today in the work of member artists [Ai Weiwei](/artist/ai-weiwei), [Wang Keping](/artist/wang-keping), [Li Shuang](/artist/li-shuang), [Huang Rui](/artist/huang-rui), and affiliates [Zhang Hongtu](/artist/zhang-hongtu) and [Zhang Wei](/artist/zhang-wei-zhang-wei-b-1952).","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/lYajGUJJ51yW-JABeThVIQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/lYajGUJJ51yW-JABeThVIQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/534db7be7622ddcc1d0001c5"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/the-stars-art-group-xing-xing"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=534db7be7622ddcc1d0001c5"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=534db7be7622ddcc1d0001c5&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=534db7be7622ddcc1d0001c5"}}},{"id":"53d980f072616974d3f70300","created_at":"2014-07-30T23:34:08+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:12+00:00","name":"The Sublime","display_name":null,"description":"A term drawn from philosophy and closely associated with the wonders of [nature](/gene/nature), the sublime is meant to describe that which inspires feelings of awe, grandeur, or even anxiety and helplessness in the face of power that surpasses human scale or comprehension.

After centuries of being relegated to ethnological displays and curio cabinets, traditional African art entered into the European consciousness (and museums) as “art” at the turn of the 20th century, in part through its association with the European avant-garde. European modernists admired the aesthetics of what they called “Primitive Art,” a designation that conflated African art with [traditional Oceanic](/gene/traditional-oceanic-art) and [pre-Columbian art](/gene/pre-columbian-art), reflecting the racial and cultural bias against non-White, non-Western cultures at the time. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the study of African art in Europe and America took a scientific and anthropological turn, the term “Tribal Art” was considered preferable to the derogatory connotations of “primitive.” While “Tribal Art” is still used by some experts and collectors today, others reject it for failing to treat African art distinctly. The term “Traditional African Art,” though still problematic for its reductive grouping of diverse cultures under one geographic umbrella, is generally favored today.

Its name derives from Italian critic Achille Bonito Oliva’s 1981 essay entitled “The International Trans-Avant-Garde.” In this essay, Oliva named a small group of painters who, in the 1970s, departed from the dominant conceptual tendencies of the previous decade, exploring the expressive potential of painting with often universal or archaic motifs. This practice mirrored similar trends in expressive figurative painting across Europe and the United States, leading to the group’s frequent inclusion in discussions of 1980s [Neo-Expressionism](/gene/neo-expressionism). For Oliva, the trans-avant-garde rejected the original avant-garde’s “hysteria for the new” by returning to styles of the past.

The concept of trauma as personal struggle, however, became foundational in Greek mythology, with the trials and tribulations of a hero lying at the heart of Greek tragic drama. Medieval Christian art developed the motif known as the “Man of Sorrows”—a wounded and bloodied Christ figure, bearing a crown of thorns and a sorrowful expression—as an evocative reminder of suffering, meant to invoke devotion on the part of the viewer. In the 20th century, artists have been less concerned with the connection of pain to spiritual redemption, and more with the emotional and psychological toll exacted by violence, injury, suffering, or war. Iconic examples include [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s  _Guernica_ and works by [Otto Dix](/artist/otto-dix). World War II and the Holocaust had a profound impact on art; [Christian Boltanski](/artist/christian-boltanski) and [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), for example, developed different modes of representation to respond to the traumatic nature of those events. Others have examined the collective traumas associated with slavery, apartheid, AIDS, and immigration, while artists such as [Louise Bourgeois](/artist/louise-bourgeois) and [Eva Hesse](/artist/eva-hesse) probed the psychological anguish stemming from individual experiences of childhood and personal anxiety.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/m3AQ3HJpU24sMSXGMHmA5A/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/m3AQ3HJpU24sMSXGMHmA5A/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5266f7739c18db61120002d3"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/trauma-and-struggle"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5266f7739c18db61120002d3"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5266f7739c18db61120002d3&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5266f7739c18db61120002d3"}}},{"id":"4e6a4334ec5e52000107c835","created_at":"2011-09-09T16:47:48+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T20:18:18+00:00","name":"Travel/Tourism","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks that engage with the subject of travel or tourism.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/yGT-RUVfrdEEVLZkFvPLVA/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/yGT-RUVfrdEEVLZkFvPLVA/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/4e6a4334ec5e52000107c835"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/travel-slash-tourism"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=4e6a4334ec5e52000107c835"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=4e6a4334ec5e52000107c835&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=4e6a4334ec5e52000107c835"}}},{"id":"507c4b75b5f0450002001b2b","created_at":"2012-10-15T17:44:21+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:43:13+00:00","name":"Tray","display_name":null,"description":"Trays—not depictions of them, in [paintings](/gene/painting) or [photographs](/gene/photography), but the physical objects.

The Floating World, as the pleasure districts of Edo (modern day Tokyo) were called, describes the sensory pleasures of urban life, but also offers a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting nature of all worldly delights. It’s commonly said that in Edo Japan, anyone could own a masterpiece Ukiyo-e print for about the price of a bowl of noodles. While this claim oversimplifies, it is true that by the 17th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers innovated centuries-old woodblock text printing techniques to create colorful picture prints that were distributed widely for popular consumption. Some of the greatest Japanese artists of their time—[Ando Hiroshige](/artist/utagawa-hiroshige-ando-hiroshige), [Katsushika Hokusai](/artist/katsushika-hokusai), [Utagawa Toyokuni III](/artist/utagawa-toyokuni-iii-utagawa-kunisada), and [Keisai Eisen](/artist/keisai-eisen) among them—became known primarily as woodblock print designers in the Ukiyo-e style. In the 19th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers also began to focus on landscape, creating series such as Hokusai’s famed _Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji_. Ukiyo-e also had a profound impact on European artists around this time—its flattened perspective and innovative compositions inspired artists such as [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), [Vincent Van Gogh](/artist/vincent-van-gogh), and [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec), as well as the [Japonisme](/gene/japonisme) movement in art and design.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ZMN7jMzl1WDPpj-efPU6Mg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ZMN7jMzl1WDPpj-efPU6Mg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5367eaf9275b2431b0000008"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/ukiyo-e"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5367eaf9275b2431b0000008"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5367eaf9275b2431b0000008&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5367eaf9275b2431b0000008"}}},{"id":"50a578df7ff077605f0001cb","created_at":"2012-11-15T23:21:04+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-09T13:36:23+00:00","name":"Union des Artistes Modernes","display_name":null,"description":"The Union des Artistes Modernes was a group of French architects and designers founded in 1929 by [Robert Mallet-Stevens](https://www.artsy.net/artist/robert-mallet-stevens).

The school's influence proved great stylistically, too: its pleasure-seeking, even poetic sensibility, which stood in contrast to the cool, studied quality of Italian [Mannerism](/gene/mannerism) paved the way for the melodramatic vividness of 17th century [Baroque](/gene/baroque).\n","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/2V4YLrCQZ3eS24xLoy5C-Q/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/2V4YLrCQZ3eS24xLoy5C-Q/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/5069c023d770f60002000595"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/venetian-school"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=5069c023d770f60002000595"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=5069c023d770f60002000595&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=5069c023d770f60002000595"}}},{"id":"507c4a66c51f290002001b92","created_at":"2012-10-15T17:39:50+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-12T07:11:22+00:00","name":"Vessel","display_name":null,"description":"[Bowls](/gene/bowl), [vases](/gene/vase]), and other hollow containers characteristically used for liquids.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/aOzDWNlUln8S9lYfCCAhig/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/aOzDWNlUln8S9lYfCCAhig/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/507c4a66c51f290002001b92"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/vessel"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=507c4a66c51f290002001b92"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=507c4a66c51f290002001b92&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=507c4a66c51f290002001b92"}}},{"id":"4de6871ead506e00010054eb","created_at":"2011-06-01T18:38:22+00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-11T07:55:20+00:00","name":"Vienna Secession","display_name":null,"description":"_“We recognize no distinction between high and low art, between art for the rich and art for the poor.

The Vienna Secession, as it quickly became known, hoped to promote modern art at every level of society by presenting exhibitions free from the strict guidelines of Vienna’s annual salon. This pioneering group, closely associated with [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau), also strove to create a new style of architecture.

They were among the earliest adopters of acrylic paint, which they often applied directly onto raw, unprimed canvas.","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/0i6Enxr2E1kdS-ktZIpZNQ/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/0i6Enxr2E1kdS-ktZIpZNQ/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/54ee5b9472616976490e0200"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/washington-color-school"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=54ee5b9472616976490e0200"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=54ee5b9472616976490e0200&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=54ee5b9472616976490e0200"}}},{"id":"568c0dd5139b2158e500003d","created_at":"2016-01-05T18:39:17+00:00","updated_at":"2017-07-27T01:23:28+00:00","name":"Watches","display_name":null,"description":"","image_versions":["big_and_tall","square500","tall","thumb"],"_links":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_bvwJjODihsx_j9nSN8Wdg/big_and_tall.jpg"},"image":{"href":"https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/_bvwJjODihsx_j9nSN8Wdg/{image_version}.jpg","templated":true},"self":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/genes/568c0dd5139b2158e500003d"},"permalink":{"href":"http://www.artsy.net/gene/watches"},"artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?gene_id=568c0dd5139b2158e500003d"},"published_artworks":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artworks?artist_id=568c0dd5139b2158e500003d&published=true"},"artists":{"href":"https://api.artsy.net/api/artists?gene_id=568c0dd5139b2158e500003d"}}},{"id":"5036a9f69da54500020004ac","created_at":"2012-08-23T22:08:54+00:00","updated_at":"2017-09-28T20:31:05+00:00","name":"Water","display_name":null,"description":"Artworks that depict the fleeting forms and colors of water as observed from a distance, studied microscopically, or experienced from within.

Variations on this practice have existed around the world, with early instances including ancient Egyptian papyrus painting, ancient Chinese silk painting, and medieval manuscripts. Greater standardization in watercolor production was furthered by the wide distribution of a list of usable pigments in 17th-century England and the invention of portable watercolor boxes in the early 18th century. Old Masters like [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) and [Sir Anthony Van Dyck](/artist/sir-anthony-van-dyck) used the medium primarily for landscapes, though often as a delicate accent in ink and chalk drawings. Watercolor gained its strongest standing in the United Kingdom, with watercolorists gaining admission to the Royal Academy by the end of the 18th century and [J. M. W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner) adopting it as a preferred medium. While less admired in continental Europe, the signature Impressionist styles of [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne) and [Camille Pissarro](/artist/camille-pissarro) were both greatly indebted to the medium.
